## Introduction

This is the collection of the much requested Rectify11 port for Windhawk's [Resource Redirect](https://windhawk.net/mods/icon-resource-redirect) mod. Rectify11 is a tool that allows you to customize your Windows 11 experience and make it more consistent by modifying system files. The advantage of using this resource pack is the instant activation or deactivation of the loading of Rectify11 resource all in memory without the requirement of modifying system files. This results in future Windows system updates not changing the resources loaded by the Resources Redirect mod, which otherwise patching the system files would have. Not all of the components of Rectify11 are included in this resource pack as their not supported by this mod, such as custom Windows themes, cursors, wallpapers, system fonts and third-party software package, as they require the official installer.

> [!NOTE]
> The Redirect Redirect mod works with many types of resources listed [here](https://windhawk.net/mods/icon-resource-redirect).

## Installation
If you're not familiar with Windhawk, here are the steps for installing the mod:

* Download Windhawk from [windhawk.net](https://windhawk.net/) and install it.

* Unzip and extract the theme folder in a directory of your system.
* First run as admin the `CopyNeccessary.bat` script.
* Copy the path of the theme folder (right click - copy as path) which contains the theme files.
* Open Windhawk, go to the already installed "Resource Redirect" mod.

> [!TIP]
> For a cleaner look, use [the script to disable folder thumbnail previews](https://github.com/Undisputed00x/R11-resource-redirect/blob/main/Scripts/Disable_folder_thumbnail_previews.bat).

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't move the theme files or change their filenames unless you know how the theme redirection works!

> [!Important]
> Rectify11 Resource Redirect works best with Rectify11 windows themes. <br />
> In case of some visual inconsistencies in the UI of Windows, <br />
> Use Rectify11 installer from their [website](https://rectify11.net/home) to install the custom themes
